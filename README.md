# wardrobe
This application is a sample exercise in week 7 of WeCanCodeIT Winter 2017 Boot camp.  This is a database-first web application for managing the contents of a wardrobe.  The photos that display in the details for each clothing type were uploaded to the Content file and are viewed via a relative URL of the form ~/Content/[photoname here].jpg.
Articles of clothing entered into the database reference an integer for the photo field.  Future methods can be included in the closet controller to call a photo associated with the user input number.
